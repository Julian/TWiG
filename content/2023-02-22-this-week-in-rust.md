### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall a fairly positive week, with few noise-related regressions or
improvements and many benchmarks showing significant improvements. The one
large regression is limited to documentation builds and has at least a partial
fix already planned.

Other wins this week include an average [improvement][memopt] of around 1% in
maximum memory usage of optimized builds, and a 2% average [reduction][sizeopt]
in compiled binary sizes. These are fairly significant wins for these metrics.

[memopt]: https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9bb6e60d1f1360234aae90c97964c0fa5524f141&end=3fee48c161a48b0c142d3998fff56faee96bd56c&absolute=false&stat=max-rss&kind=percentfromfirst

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: search by macro when query ends with `!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108143)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize rustdoc `--test-run-directory`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103682)
* [disposition: merge] [Treat `str` as containing `[u8]` for auto trait purposes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107941)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

* [new] [Stabilize may_dangle](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3390)
* [new] [Add a `[lints]` table to `Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3389)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> It‚Äôs *enjoyable* to write Rust, which is maybe kind of weird to say, but it‚Äôs just the language is fantastic. It‚Äôs fun. You feel like a magician, and that never happens in other languages.

‚Äì [Parker Timmerman cited in a TechnologyReview article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/)
