### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Some noisy benchmarks impeded performance review this week. There was a notable
improvement to a broad range of primary benchmarks, first from PR #108440, which
revised the encodable proc macro to handle the discriminant separately from its
fields, and second from PR #108375, which inlined a number of methods that had
only a single caller. Both of these PR's were authored by the same contributor;
many thanks Zoxc!

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [3fee48c1..31f858d9](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3fee48c161a48b0c142d3998fff56faee96bd56c&end=31f858d9a511f24fedb8ed997b28304fec809630&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 6 Mixed; 6 of them in rollups
39 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Move std::net::IpAddr types into core::net.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2832)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
